# ClipMaker v1.2.3 for Windows

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or newer
- Python 3.10+ installed and available on `PATH`
- Internet access for first-time package installs and Playwright Chromium download

## Quick Start

1. Open this folder in File Explorer.
2. Double-click `Launch_ClipMaker.bat`.
3. Wait for the setup checks to finish.
4. Your browser should open the local ClipMaker URL shown in the launcher window.

Keep the launcher window open while you use the app.

## What the launcher does

`Launch_ClipMaker.bat` will:

- verify Python is installed
- install missing Python packages with `python -m pip install --user`
- install the Playwright Chromium browser if needed
- download `plotly-2.27.0.min.js` into `smp_component/frontend/`
- apply the Streamlit theme patch once
- start the app with Streamlit on the first free port from `8501` to `8510`

## Manual Setup

If you want to set it up yourself in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "C:\path\to\ClipMaker_v1.2_Windows"
python -m pip install --user streamlit moviepy pandas plotly curl_cffi playwright numpy
python -m playwright install chromium
python download_fonts.py
python patch_streamlit.py
```

Then launch:

```powershell
python -m streamlit run .\ClipMaker.py --server.port 8501 --server.headless false --browser.gatherUsageStats false
```

If port `8501` is already in use, pick another local port such as `8502`.

## Optional Helper Scripts

- `download_plotly.bat`: downloads the local Plotly bundle used by the Analyst Room maps
- `download_fonts.py`: downloads local font files into `static/fonts/`

## Common Issues

### Python is not found

Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and make sure `Add Python to PATH` is checked during setup.

### Browser does not open automatically

Open the `http://localhost:<port>` URL shown in the launcher window manually.

### Browse buttons do not work

Your Python install may be missing `tkinter`. Reinstall Python with the default Windows options.
